# wincut
An Alternative Version & Fork of [Duplicut](https://github.com/nil0x42/duplicut) for Windows.
Here I go once again to prove that the impossible can be done.

## Good News
- It compiles
- And it works!!!
- Your Likely Decades of waiting is over!!!

## TODOS
- [ ] add mimalloc or make it entirely optional...
- [ ] Fixing terminal colors, Currently turned it off temporarly...
- [ ] Youtube video? Maybe I have a few months off as of 2025...
- [ ] I think I want to add a feature that allows us to use it on larger files that are over 1-4 Gigabytes
- [ ] Code might get dual licensed where the edits I made are AGPL while duplicut's code remains GPL
